# HTML 
HyperText Markup Language


## Last time 


* Source code control with git
* File; commit; branch; repository; remote
* init/clone; add; commit; (pull then) push



## Today

* HTML tags
* What makes a good HTML page
* Web front-end frameworks


## HTML tags

(In groups)

* Introduce yourselves
* List the HTML tags you are familiar with 
  - five minutes
* One person to create a text file with them in
  - one per line
  - just the name of the tag (no angle brackets)


## Putting them together

* Paste into shared doc
* We'll make a [word cloud](https://www.wordclouds.com/)


## What makes a good HTML page?


* Standards compliant HTML5 [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/) 
  - Check with <https://validator.w3.org/>
  - Or developer tools or chrome plugin
* Accessible: alt tags; contrast; [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/); [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)
* Mobile-friendly: viewport; lightweight; responsive
* Quick-loading
* Review with e.g. [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)



## Web Front-end Frameworks

- Provide pre-written HTML and JavaScript
- Apply styles with CSS classes
- Make it easy to make things look nice
- Make it easy to make things responsive
- Can sometimes be heavy (large file size, slow)
- e.g. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [alternatives](https://classpert.com/blog/top-bootstrap-alternatives)


## Pasta

To sieve out the stuff we don't want we can

- make our page HTML5 compliant
- include it in a bootstrap template
